Brain computer interface based on electroencephalographic data (EEG data) with the help of machine learning algorithms.   
Using a subject’s EEG reading, infer what he or she is thinking about or doing - (motion) A or B in a t0 to tn timeframe.   
• Process EEG datas (parsing and filtering)   
• Implement a dimensionality reduction algorithm    
• Use the pipeline object from scikit-learn   
• Classify a data stream in "real time"
